Agent based Modelling for Leaflet Delivery 
This project was created as part of the Master's thesis by Kilian Heyer.

The fake_timetable is a dummy data containing fake data. Because of a data protection agreement with Feibra GmbH the origianl Data must not be published. 
A exact reproduktion of the thesis results is not possible with this time table but proportionate result should be generated.

To run the model GAMA version 1.8.2 is needed. It my funktion with higher versionst but this was not testet.

* To run this model sucessfully you must give it the adresses, streets, start_point,road for deliverer as shp and the delivery_time as csv.
* An error can also appear if the files to save the data do not exist.
